THIS FOLDER CONTAINS SERIES OF CODING LESSONS
I'VE WATCHED.

THERE ARE INUMEROUS COMMENTARIES AS A WAY OF
INSTRUCTING WHOEVER CHOOSES TO LOOK AT THEM.

THE COMMENTARIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY PART OF THE CODE,
I'D ALSO RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET RID OF ANY (OR MOST) 
COMMENTARIES IN YOUR CODING.

HOPE YOU ENJOY! :)
